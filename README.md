# The Quiz - Rust Edition

A little quiz I made as a project to learn Rust. It reads a xml file with questions and the prompts them to the user who cna answer them. At the end it displays a score.

This code is rather messy as I am still learning Rust but I might later go back to this and improve on it once I gotten better with the language.

To run this, just using ``cargo run`` or building it and running the exe from terminal should be work. Just make sure that the directory you are running it from has the "question.xml" file in it.
